# speech-processing
An old project that I developed for the Speech Processing course in University of Piraeus, Department of Informatics. Inside chapter_10, there is a Bayesian classifier that assigns speech data to two classes (voice or unvoiced), and a pitch estimation algorithm. Training data and relevant files originate from Theory and Applications of Digital Speech Processing, L.Rabiner & R.W.Schafer. The code is old, hence it could certainly use some improvements but both algorithms achieve good results. Libraries used include librosa, scipy, numpy, soundfile, matplotlib.

# Update (5/7/2021)
I decided to reread some sections of the book and implement a few more algorithms, while cleaning up and refactoring some old code. The repository will thus be updated and new files will be uploaded.
# Update (9/5/2022)
Cleaned up old code, organized files into proper directories and renamed them to be more descriptive.
