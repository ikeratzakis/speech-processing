# speech-processing
An old project that I developed for the Speech Processing course in University of Piraeus, Department of Informatics. The repository actually consists of two seperate projects. The 10_5 file is a Bayesian classifier that assigns speech data to two classes (voice or unvoiced). The 10_7 file is a pitch estimation algorithm. Training data and relevant files originate from Theory and Applications of Digital Speech Processing, L.Rabiner & R.W.Schafer. The code is old, hence it could certainly use some improvements but both algorithms achieve good results. Libraries used include librosa, scipy, numpy, soundfile, matplotlib.

# Update (5/7/2021)
I decided to reread some sections of the book and implement a few more algorithms, while cleaning up and refactoring some old code. The repository will thus be updated and new files will be uploaded. 10_1 demonstrates the effects of different kinds of filtering on the zero crossing rate, and 10_4 utilizes a simple algorithm (given in the text) to detect speech sections inside an audio signal. There seems to be some error in the way the exercise is written on the book, so the exact parameters are still being worked on.
